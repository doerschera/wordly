## About

Word.ly is a place for writers to browse and favorite dynamic words. Inspired by [colorhunt.co](www.colorhunt.co), Word.ly allows writers to add, favorite, and update words. Favorited words are stored in the user's local storage to make the site accessible without a login barrier. User's can also use a filter feature to browse words by type. When submitting a new word, the user's addition is validated against a dictonary API as well as the database to confirm that the submission is both an English word and does not already exists in the database.
